## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### 1. **Quick Start with Your Runner**

```yaml
name: My Workflow
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    # Replace with your runner name/labels
    runs-on: arc-runner-set
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Hello World
        run: echo "Hello from self-hosted runner!"
```

### 2. **Dynamic Runner Selection**

```yaml
# Go to Actions → CI workflow → Run workflow
# Select runner type: github-hosted, self-hosted, or arc-runner-set
```

### 3. **Custom Runner Labels**

```yaml
jobs:
  secure-build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, secure, fast-ssd]
    steps:
      - name: Secure build
        run: echo "Running on secure infrastructure"
```

## 📋 **Setup Checklist**

### For Organizations Using Self-Hosted Runners:

#### ✅ **Step 1: Choose Your Setup**

- [ ] Traditional self-hosted runners (manual setup)
- [ ] Actions Runner Controller (Kubernetes-based)
- [ ] Cloud-based self-hosted runners (AWS, Azure, GCP)

#### ✅ **Step 2: Install Required Software**

- [ ] Node.js 20 LTS
- [ ] npm 8+
- [ ] Git 2.20+
- [ ] Docker (optional)
- [ ] System monitoring tools

#### ✅ **Step 3: Configure Runners**

- [ ] Download and configure GitHub Actions runner
- [ ] Set appropriate labels (e.g., `self-hosted`, `linux`, `secure`)
- [ ] Configure as a service for reliability
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

#### ✅ **Step 4: Update Workflows**

- [ ] Modify `runs-on` values in workflow files
- [ ] Test with the self-hosted-example workflow
- [ ] Update any environment-specific settings
- [ ] Configure secrets and environment variables

#### ✅ **Step 5: Security & Maintenance**

- [ ] Implement security best practices
- [ ] Set up regular maintenance schedules
- [ ] Monitor performance and resource usage
- [ ] Plan for scaling and high availability

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**

### ✅ **Implemented Security Features**

- 🛡️ **Isolated execution environments**
- 🔐 **Minimal permission workflows**
