# 🏃 Self-Hosted Runners Only - Configuration Summary

## ✅ **All Workflows Now Use Only Self-Hosted Runners**

All GitHub workflows have been updated to use **only self-hosted runners** (`arc-runner-set`) while still leveraging GitHub Actions marketplace actions like `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, etc.

#### 6. **📖 Documentation** (`docs.yml`)

- ✅ All 5 jobs now use `arc-runner-set`
- ✅ Generation, quality check, deployment, link validation, PR comments

#### 7. **❄️ Nix Environment** (`nix.yml`)

- ✅ All 8 jobs now use `arc-runner-set`
- ✅ Removed cross-platform matrix (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest)

## 🎯 **What This Means**

### ✅ **Benefits**

- **🔒 Complete Control**: All builds run on your infrastructure
- **💰 Cost Savings**: No GitHub Actions minutes usage
- **⚡ Performance**: Dedicated resources, no queuing
- **🛡️ Security**: Air-gapped or controlled network environment
- **🎯 Consistency**: All jobs run in the same environment

### ⚠️ **Requirements**

Your `arc-runner-set` runners must have:

- **Node.js 18, 20, 22** (for matrix testing)
- **All development tools** (npm, git, docker, etc.)
- **Sufficient resources** for parallel job execution
- **Network access** for GitHub Actions marketplace actions

## 🔧 **Runner Requirements**

### **Essential Software**

```bash
# Required on all arc-runner-set runners
- Node.js 18+ (multiple versions for matrix)
- npm 8+
- Git 2.20+
- Docker (for some actions)
- Basic Unix tools (curl, tar, gzip, etc.)
```

### **System Resources**

```bash
# Recommended specifications
- CPU: 4+ cores (for parallel jobs)
- RAM: 8GB+ (for multiple Node.js versions)
- Disk: 50GB+ (for dependencies and artifacts)
- Network: Stable, fast connection
```

### **Example Runner Setup**

```bash
# Install Node.js versions
nvm install 18
nvm install 20
nvm install 22

# Verify all versions work
nvm use 18 && node --version
nvm use 20 && node --version
nvm use 22 && node --version

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install additional tools
sudo apt-get install git curl wget jq
```

## 🚀 **GitHub Actions Still Used**

### **Marketplace Actions Utilized**

- ✅ `actions/checkout@v4` - Repository checkout
- ✅ `actions/setup-node@v4` - Node.js version management
- ✅ `actions/cache@v4` - Dependency caching
- ✅ `actions/upload-artifact@v4` - Artifact storage
- ✅ `actions/download-artifact@v4` - Artifact retrieval
- ✅ `codecov/codecov-action@v4` - Coverage reporting
- ✅ `github/codeql-action/*` - Security scanning
- ✅ `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` - Documentation deployment
- ✅ `actions/github-script@v7` - GitHub API interactions

### **What Runs on Self-Hosted**

- ✅ **Everything**: All computation, testing, building
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: Download and execute on your runners
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Installed on your infrastructure
- ✅ **Artifacts**: Stored and processed on your runners

## 📊 **Current Workflow Status**

| Workflow      | Jobs | All Self-Hosted | Actions Used        |
| ------------- | ---- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| CI            | 6    | ✅              | 8 different actions |
| Security      | 7    | ✅              | 6 different actions |
| Performance   | 4    | ✅              | 5 different actions |
| Release       | 6    | ✅              | 7 different actions |
| Dependencies  | 3    | ✅              | 4 different actions |
| Documentation | 5    | ✅              | 6 different actions |
| Nix           | 8    | ✅              | 3 different actions |

**Total: 39 jobs, all running on `arc-runner-set`**

## 🔍 **Verification**

### **Check Configuration**

```bash
# Search for any remaining GitHub-hosted runners
grep -r "ubuntu-latest\|windows-latest\|macos-latest" .github/workflows/

# Should return no results if properly configured
```

### **Test Your Setup**

1. **Trigger a workflow** manually via GitHub Actions UI
2. **Verify execution** happens on your `arc-runner-set` runners
3. **Check logs** for proper GitHub Actions execution
4. **Monitor resources** on your runner infrastructure

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Single Runner Set**

- All jobs use `arc-runner-set` - ensure this matches your actual runner configuration
- If you have different runner labels, update the workflows accordingly

### **Parallel Execution**

- Multiple jobs may run simultaneously on your runners
- Ensure adequate resources for parallel execution
- Consider runner auto-scaling if using Kubernetes

### **Network Requirements**

- Runners need internet access for GitHub Actions marketplace
- Actions download occurs on your runners, not GitHub's infrastructure
- Ensure firewall rules allow GitHub API access

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **✅ Verify Runner Setup**: Ensure `arc-runner-set` has all required tools
2. **🧪 Test Workflows**: Run a test workflow to verify everything works
3. **📊 Monitor Performance**: Watch resource usage during builds
4. **🔧 Optimize**: Adjust runner specifications based on actual usage
5. **📈 Scale**: Plan for auto-scaling if needed
